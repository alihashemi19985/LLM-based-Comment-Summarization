# LLM-based-Comment-Summarization
# User Comment Summarization and Analysis for Digikala Products
This project focuses on summarizing and analyzing user comments related to products on Digikala, one of the largest e-commerce platforms. The goal is to automatically extract key insights from user reviews and provide a summarized view that can help businesses and potential customers make better decisions.

# Key Features:
Data Collection:

The system collects user comments and reviews from Digikalaâ€™s product pages.
Text Preprocessing:

Preprocessing of comments includes:
Removing unnecessary characters.
Normalizing text for better processing (handling Persian-specific features like diacritics, stopwords, etc.).
Summarization Using LLM:

A Large Language Model (LLM) is used to summarize the user comments.
The model condenses multiple user reviews into concise summaries, highlighting important points such as:
Positive feedback about product quality.
Negative feedback, such as issues with durability or performance.
Sentiment Analysis:

In addition to summarization, the system performs sentiment analysis to categorize reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
Visualization and Reporting:

Summarized insights and sentiment trends are visualized in a user-friendly dashboard, allowing product managers and marketers to easily monitor user feedback.
